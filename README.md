# SocialButterfly
Designed and implemented a Social Media web Application which allows users to post, follow, comment and like each
other's post as well as create own pages to innovate, inform and inspire.
Used Django and MySQL to develop the backend and database segment of the project.
Used HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap for frontend.
