# The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; 
# this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding 
# valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file,
#  but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable. An example of the __init__.py file:

# self
# The word 'self' is used to represent the instance of a class. 
# By using the "self" keyword we access the attributes and methods of the class in python.

# __init__ method
# "__init__" is a reseved method in python classes. It is called as a constructor in object oriented terminology. 
# This method is called when an object is created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.

# Without an __init__.py file, you cannot import files from another directory in a Python project.
